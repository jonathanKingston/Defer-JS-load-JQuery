This script allows you to leave loading of scripts till after the page has rendered.

To use this include the script in your header after jQuery.
Then to load a script deferred use the following:

$().deferJSLoad('url.js');


To check the js has loaded and to bind further events use code like this:

function jsTest() {
  //example of lazyloaded fancybox plugin, this binds the fancybox element after it has loaded
  $('a.popup').fancybox();
}

$(window).bind('deferJSLoaded', jsTest);
